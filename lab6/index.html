                <h1>Lab 5: Data Types & Variables</h1>
                <p>Working with Sonia, experimenting with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>I had some trouble getting the script to print on the page because I put a random ")" in the wrong place. Solved the error by looking into the console inspector. Other than that, the lab was pretty straight forward. I really enjoy working these type of assignments.</p>
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>You're looking at it! lol. Here is also the program execution:</p>
