	<p>Pseudocode an everyday task and a computer task</p>
</div>
<h4>Problems</h4>
<div>
	<p>I ran into many problems getting my code to load in my browser. My partner for the lab did not reply to any of my messages so I had to complete the lab on my own. I also had issues understanding the instructions and what to do since I had never worked in Javascript before. </p>
</div>
<h5>Results</h5>
<div>
	<p>You are looking at the results. After a slight meltdown over not understanding anything, I got back to work and figured out some of these issues. I'm not quite sure if everything was done correctly, but I did the best I could without a partner :') </p>
