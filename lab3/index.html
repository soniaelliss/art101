	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p> The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files. </p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> I had difficulty with making sure my index.html files were in the right location. I struggled with getting the things I coded to show up on my site. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> You are viewing the index.html file I created. Below is a photo of the file structure that I made:</p>
